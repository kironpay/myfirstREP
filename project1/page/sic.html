  <p>In a world where <a href="/wiki/Hunters">hunters</a>, human warriors who possess magical abilities, must battle deadly monsters to protect mankind from certain annihilation, a notoriously weak hunter named <a href="/wiki/Sung_Jinwoo">Sung Jinwoo</a> finds himself in a seemingly endless struggle for survival.</p>
  <p>One day, after narrowly surviving an overwhelmingly powerful dungeon that nearly wipes out his entire party, a mysterious program called the <a href="/wiki/System">System</a> chooses him as its sole player and in turn, gives him the extremely rare ability to level up in strength, possibly beyond any known limits.</p>
  <p>Follow Jinwoo's journey as he fights against all kinds of enemies, both man and monster, to discover the secrets of the dungeons and the true source of his powers.</p>
